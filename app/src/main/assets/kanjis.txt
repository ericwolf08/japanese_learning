一　_ いち、いっ　_ ひと _ one　_On reading: 一 【イチ】 one, best, first, foremost, beginning, start, bottom string (on a shamisen, etc.);一番 【イチバン】 number one, first, first place, best, most, game, round, bout, as a test, as an experiment, by way of experiment, by way of trial, tentatively, song (e.g. in Noh), piece; 万一 【マンイチ】 emergency, unlikely event, by some chance, by some possibility; 一々 【イチイチ】 one-by-one, separately, every single, each and every, without omission, fully, in detail; 一に 【イツニ】 solely, entirely, only, or ; 一形式 【イツケイシキ】 one form (of), a form of; 万一 【マンイチ】 emergency, unlikely event, by some chance, by some possibility; 唯一 【ユイイツ】 only, sole, unique; Kun reading: 一つ 【ひとつ】 one, for one thing, only, (not) even, just (e.g. "just try it"); 一月 【ひとつき】 one month　_　In Chinese characters, the number one is laid on its side, unlike the Roman numeral I which stands upright. As you would expect, it is is written from left to right.
二　_ に　_ ふた　_ two　_On Reading: 二 【ニ】 two; 二人 【フタリ】 two persons, two people, pair, couple; 第二 【ダイニ】 second; 中二 【チュウニ】 second-year of junior high; 二乗 【ニジョウ】 squaring, multiplying (a number) by itself, second power; 次男 【ジナン】 second son; 不二 【フジ】 being two sides of the same coin, being the same (while appearing different), Very sincerely yours, peerless, unparalleled, unparallelled; 唯一不二 【ユイイツフジ】 one and only, unique; Kun Reading: 二 【に】 two; 二人 【ふたり】 two persons, two people, pair, couple; 二つ 【ふたつ】 two; 二つ目 【ふたつめ】 one after next, second; 再び 【ふたたび】 again, once more, a second time_ Like the Roman numeral II, which reduplicates the numeral I, the kanji for two is a simple reduplication of the horizontal stroke that means one. The order of writing goes from above to below, with the first stroke slightly shorter.
三　_ さん　_ みっ　_ three　_On Reading: 三 【サン】 three; 三 【サン】 three, tri-; 再三 【サイサン】 again and again, repeatedly; 二三 【ニサン】 two or three; Kun Reading: 三 【さん】 three, tri-; 三つ 【みっつ】 three; 三つ 【みっつ】 three; 三つ子 【みつご】 three-year-old, triplets; 三つ 【みっつ】 three　_ And like the Roman numeral III, which triples the numeral I, the kanji for three simply triples the single horizontal stroke. In writing it, think of “1 + 2 = 3” (一 + 二 = 三) in order to keep the middle stroke shorter.
四　_ し _ よん、よ、よっ　_ four　_On Reading: 四 【シ】 four; 四季 【シキ】 four seasons; 再三再四 【サイサンサイシ】 repeatedly; 十四 【ジュウシ】 14, fourteen; Kun Reading: 四 【し】 four; 四つ 【よっつ】 four; 四つ 【よっつ】 four; 四つ角 【よつかど】 four corners, crossroads; 四つ 【よっつ】 four; 四つん這い 【よっつんばい】 (crawl) on all fours, on one's hands and feet, falling flat; 四 【し】 four; 四十 【よんじゅう】 forty; 十四 【じゅうし】 14, fourteen; 第四 【だいよん】 fourth　_ This character is composed of two primitive elements, mouth 口　and human legs 儿, both of which we will meet in the coming lessons. Assuming that you already knew how to write this kanji, we will pass over the “story” connected with it until later. Note how the second stroke is written left-to-right and then top-to-bottom. This is consistent with what we have already seen in the first three numbers and leads us to a general principle that will be helpful when we come to more complicated kanji later on: write north-to-south, west-to-east, northwest-to-southeast.
五　_ ご　_ いつ _ five　_On Reading: 五月 【ゴガツ】 May; 十五 【ジュウゴ】 15, fifteen; 三三五五 【サンサンゴゴ】 in groups of twos and threes, in small groups; Kun Reading: 五 【ご】 five; 五つ 【いつつ】 five; 五つ 【いつつ】 five; 五つ子 【いつつご】 quintuplets　_ As with four, we shall postpone learning the primitive elements that make up this character. Note how the general principle we 16 Remembering the Kanji just learned in the preceding frame applies to the writing of the character for　five.
六　_ ろく、ろっ　_ もっ _ six　_On Reading: 六 【ロク】 six; 六月 【ロクガツ】 June; 十六 【ジュウロク】 16, sixteen; 才六 【サイロク】 kid, brat, Edo term used to debase people from Kansai; 六官 【リクカン】 six ministries (of Zhou-dynasty China); 六気 【ロッキ】 yin, yang, wind, rain, darkness, light, cold, heat, dryness, dampness, wind, fire, six emotions (joy, anger, sorrow, pleasure, love, hate); Kun Reading: 六 【ろく】 six; 難しい 【むずかしい】 difficult, hard, troublesome, complicated, serious (disease, problem, etc.), fussy, particular, fastidious, hard to please, displeased, gloomy, glum, sullen, serious (look), dirty, unclean, filthy, detestable, unpleasant, uncomfortable, creepy, spooky; 六つ 【むっつ】 six; 難しい 【むずかしい】 difficult, hard, troublesome, complicated, serious (disease, problem, etc.), fussy, particular, fastidious, hard to please, displeased, gloomy, glum, sullen, serious (look), dirty, unclean, filthy, detestable, unpleasant, uncomfortable, creepy, spooky; 六つ 【むっつ】 six; 六日 【むいか】 sixth day of the month, six days; 六日間戦争 【むいかかんせんそう】 Six-Day War, Third Arab-Israeli War (June 5-10, 1967)　_ The primitives here are top hat and animal legs. Once again, we glide over them until later.
七　_ しち　_ なな _ seven　_On Reading: 七 【シチ】 seven, hepta-; 七月 【シチガツ】 July; 十七 【ジュウシチ】 17, seventeen; セシウム１３７ 【セシウムヒャクサンジュウシチ】 cesium 137 (Cs-137), caesium 137; Kun Reading: 七 【しち】 seven, hepta-; 七つ 【ななつ】 seven; 十七 【じゅうしち】 17, seventeen; 七つ 【ななつ】 seven; 七帯アルマジロ 【ななつおびアルマジロ】 seven-banded armadillo (Dasypus septemcinctus); 七日 【なのか】 the seventh day of the month, seven days　_ Note that the first stroke “cuts” through the second. This distinguishes seven from the character for spoon 七, in which the horizontal stroke stops short.
八　_ はち、はっ　_ やっ　_ eight　_On Reading: 八 【ハチ】 eight; 八月 【ハチガツ】 August; 百八 【ヒャクハチ】 108, one hundred and eight, the number of kleshas, worldly thoughts and passions, the sum of 12 months, 24 seasons of the solar year, and 72 'climates' of one year; 十八 【ジュウハチ】 18, eighteen; Kun Reading: 八 【はち】 eight; 八百屋 【やおや】 greengrocer; 八つ 【やっつ】 eight; 八つ当たり 【やつあたり】 outburst of anger, venting one's anger; お八つ 【おやつ】 between-meal snack, mid-afternoon (around 3 o'clock) snack, afternoon refreshment, afternoon tea; 八つ 【やっつ】 eight; 八日 【ようか】 the eighth day of the month, eight days　_ Just as the Arabic numeral “8” is composed of a small circle followed by a larger one, so the kanji for eight is composed of a short line followed by a longer line, slanting towards it but not touching it. And just as the “lazy 8” ∞ is the mathematical symbol for “infinity,” so the expanse opened up below these two strokes is associated by the Japanese with the sense of an infinite expanse or something “all-encompassing.”
九　_ きゅう、く　_ ここの _ nine　_On Reading: 九 【キュウ】 nine; 九州 【キュウシュウ】 Kyushu (southernmost of the four main islands of Japan); 十九 【ジュウキュウ】 19, nineteen; 九 【キュウ】 nine; 九月 【クガツ】 September; 十中八九 【ジッチュウハック】 8 or 9 cases out of ten, in all probability; 九九 【クク】 multiplication table, times table; Kun Reading: 九 【きゅう】 nine; 九つ 【ここのつ】 nine; 九つ時 【ここのつどき】 (approx.) 12 o'clock (am or pm), noon, midnight　_ If you take care to remember the stroke order of this kanji, you will not have trouble later keeping it distinct from the kanji for power 九.
十　_ じゅう、じゅっ、じっ　_ とお　_ ten　_On Reading: 十 【ジュウ】 ten; 十一 【ジュウイチ】 11, eleven, Hodgson's hawk-cuckoo (Cuculus fugax), Horsfield's hawk cuckoo; 六十 【ロクジュウ】 sixty; 九十 【キュウジュウ】 ninety; 十種競技 【ジッシュキョウギ】 decathlon; 十指 【ジッシ】 the ten fingers; 十指 【ジッシ】 the ten fingers; 十回 【ジッカイ】 ten times; Kun Reading: 十 【じゅう】 ten; 十日 【とおか】 the tenth day of the month, ten days; 十 【じゅう】 ten; 十日 【とおか】 the tenth day of the month, ten days　_ Turn this character 45º either way and you have the x used for the Roman numeral ten.
百　_ ひゃく、ぴゃく、びゃく　_ _ hundred　_On Reading: 百 【ヒャク】 100, hundred; 百万 【ヒャクマン】 1,000,000, one million, million, many; 数百 【スウヒャク】 several hundreds; 二百 【ニヒャク】 two hundred, 200; 何百 【ナンビャク】 hundreds; 三百 【サンビャク】 300, three hundred, 300 mon, trifling amount, two-bit item, shyster; Kun Reading: 百 【ひゃく】 100, hundred; 百声鳥 【ももこえどり】 lesser cuckoo (Cuculus poliocephalus)　_ The Japanese refer to a person’s 99th birthday as a “white year” because white is the kanji you are left with if you subtract one from a hundred.
千　_ せん、ぜん　_ _ thousand　_On Reading: 千 【セン】 1,000, thousand; 千里 【センリ】 1000 ri, (a) long distance; 一千 【イッセン】 1,000, one thousand; 四千 【ヨンセン】 four thousand; Kun Reading: 千 【せん】 1,000, thousand; 千仞 【せんじん】 great depth, bottomless, great height; 百千 【ひゃくせん】 a large number, all sorts, hundreds and thousands; 八千 【はっせん】 8000, many　_ This kanji is almost too simple to pull apart, but for the sake of practice, have a look at the drop above and the ten below. Now put the elements together by thinking of squeezing two more zeros out of an eyedropper alongside the number ten to make it a thousand.
万　_ まん　_ _ ten thousand　_On Reading: 万 【マン】 10,000, ten thousand, myriad, everything, all, various; 万年筆 【マンネンヒツ】 fountain pen; 百万 【ヒャクマン】 1,000,000, one million, million, many; 十万 【ジュウマン】 100,000, hundred thousand; 万 【バン】 many, all; 万一 【マンイチ】 emergency, unlikely event, by some chance, by some possibility; 遺憾千万 【イカンセンバン】 highly regrettable, utterly deplorable; 失礼千万 【シツレイセンバン】 extremely rude (impertinent, impolite); Kun Reading: 万 【まん】 10,000, ten thousand, myriad, everything, all, various; 万代 【ばんだい】 thousands of years, eternity, all generations; 千万 【せんばん】 exceedingly, very many, very much, indeed, a great many; 八百万 【やおよろず】 myriad, countless things;　_ Japanese counts higher numbers in units of ten thousand, unlike the West, which advances according to units of one thousand. (Thus, for instance, 40,000 would be read “four tenthousands” by a Japanese.) Given that the comma is used in larger numbers to bind up a numerical unit of one thousand, the elements for one and bound up naturally come to form ten thousand. The order of strokes here needs special attention, both because it falls outside the general principles we have learned already, and because it involves writing the element for bound up in an order opposite to the one we learned. If it is any consolation, this exception is consistent every time these three strokes come together.
円　_ えん　_ まる　_ yen; circle　_On Reading: 円 【エン】 yen, Japanese monetary unit, circle; 円満 【エンマン】 perfection, harmony, peace, smoothness, completeness, satisfaction, integrity; 一円 【イチエン】 one yen, throughout (an area), whole district; １０００円 【センエン】 1000 yen; Kun Reading: 丸い 【まるい】 round, circular, spherical, harmonious, calm; 丸 【まる】 circle, entirety, whole, full, complete, money, dough, moola, enclosure inside a castle's walls, soft-shelled turtle, suffix for ship names, suffix for names of people (esp. infants), suffix for names of swords, armour, musical instruments, etc., suffix for names of dogs, horses, etc.; 丸い 【まるい】 round, circular, spherical, harmonious, calm; 真ん丸 【まんまる】 perfect circle; 黒円 【くろまる】 black spot, black dot, bull's-eye, failure; 円居 【まどい】 small gathering, happy circle; 円か 【まどか】 round, tranquil, contentedly at ease; 円やか 【まろやか】 round, circular, spherical, mild (taste), mellow (voice)　_ This kanji, also used for Yen, is one you are not likely to need to study formally, since you can hardly get around in Japan without it. The connection is that the yennies, like pennies, are circular in shape. In any case, the elements are: glass canopy ... walking stick ... one.
時　_ じ _ とき　_ time　_On Reading: 時 【ジ】 hour, o'clock, (specified) time, when ..., during ...; 時間 【ジカン】 time, hours; 当時 【トウジ】 at that time, in those days; 一時 【イチジ】 one o'clock, once, at one time, formerly, before, for a time, for a while, for the time being, for the present, for the moment, temporarily, a time, one time, once; Kun Reading: 時 【とき】 time, hour, moment, occasion, case, chance, opportunity, season, the times, the age, the day, tense; 時計 【とけい】 watch, clock, timepiece; 一時 【ひととき】 moment, a (short) time, a while, former times, two-hour period; 片時 【かたとき】 moment, instant　_ “What is time?” asked St. Augustine in his memoirs. “Ask me not, and I know. Ask me, and I cannot tell you.” Here we have the kanji’s answer to that perennial riddle. Time is a sun rising over a Buddhist temple. It sounds almost like a Zen kõan whose repetition might yield some deep secret to the initiated. At any 78 Remembering the Kanji rate, imagining a monk seated in meditation pondering it might help us remember the character.
日　_ に、にち、にっ _ び、ひ　_ day; sun _On Reading: 日 【ニチ】 Sunday, day (of the month), counter for days, Japan; 日曜日 【ニチヨウビ】 Sunday; 今日 【キョウ】 today, this day, these days, recently, nowadays; 明日 【アシタ】 tomorrow, near future; 日月 【ジツゲツ】 sun and moon, time, days, years; 日外 【ジツガイ】 at one time, some time ago, once; 今日 【キョウ】 today, this day, these days, recently, nowadays; Kun Reading: 日 【ひ】 day, days, sun, sunshine, sunlight, case (esp. unfortunate), event; 日付 【ひづけ】 date, dating; 一日 【いちにち】 one day, first day of the month; 夕日 【ゆうひ】 evening sun, setting sun; 昨日 【キノウ】 yesterday _ This kanji is intended to be a pictograph of the sun. Recalling what we said in the previous frame about round forms, it is easy to detect the circle and the big smile that characterize our simplest drawings of the sun—like those yellow badges with the words, “Have a nice day!”
本　_ ほん _ もと　_ book; basis _On reading: 本 【ホン】 book, volume, script, this, present, main, head, real, regular, counter for long cylindrical things, counter for films, TV shows, etc., counter for goals, home runs, etc., counter for telephone calls; 本当 【ホントウ】 truth, reality, actuality, fact, proper, right, correct, official, genuine, authentic, natural, veritable; 基本 【キホン】 foundation, basis, standard; 見本 【ミホン】 sample, specimen, pattern, model, example; Kun reading: 元 【もと】 origin, source, base, basis, foundation, root, cause, ingredient, material, (somebody's) side, (somebody's) location, original cost (or capital, principal, etc.), (plant) root, (tree) trunk, first section of a waka, counter for blades of grass, tree trunks, etc., and for falcons (in falconry), handle (chopsticks, brush, etc.), grip; 元々 【もともと】 originally, by nature, from the start; 根源 【こんげん】 root, source, origin, foundation, base, principle _ Recalling that books are made of paper, and paper made of trees, one might think of a book as a slice of a tree. Can you see the “cross-cut” in the trunk of the tree? Picture it as a chainsaw cutting you out a few books with which to start your own private library.
人　_ じん、にん _ ひと　_ person _On reading: 人 【ジン】 -ian (e.g. Italian), -ite (e.g. Tokyoite), indicates nationality, race, origin, etc., -er (e.g. performer, etc.), person working with ..., indicates expertise (in a certain field), (usu. in compound words) man, person, people; 人口 【ジンコウ】 population, common talk; 外国人 【ガイコクジン】 foreigner, foreign citizen, foreign national, alien, non-Japanese; ご主人 【ゴシュジン】 your husband, her husband; 人 【ニン】 counter for people, person; 人形 【ニンギョウ】 doll, puppet, figure; 一人 【ヒトリ】 one person, alone, unmarried, solitary; 二人 【フタリ】 two persons, two people, pair, couple; Kun reading: 人 【ひと】 man, person, human being, mankind, people, human (Homo sapiens), humans as a species, character, personality, man of talent, true man, another person, other people, others, adult; 人ごみ 【ひとごみ】 crowd of people; 女の人 【おんなのひと】 woman; 狩人 【かりゅうど】 hunter _ While the character for "enter" showed someone walking inwards (in terms of the direction of writing), the one for person, shown here, represents someone walking outwards.
月　_ げつ、がつ _ つき　_ moon; month _On reading: 月 【ゲツ】 Monday; 月曜日 【ゲツヨウビ】 Monday; 先月 【センゲツ】 last month; 来月 【ライゲツ】 next month; 月 【ガツ】 month (of the year), used after number or question word (e.g. nan or nani); 月中 【ゲツチュウ】 (for the) whole month; 四月 【シガツ】 April; 六月 【ロクガツ】 June; Kun reading: 月 【つき】 moon, month; 月末 【げつまつ】 end of the month; 毎月 【まいつき】 every month, each month, monthly; 年月 【としつき】 months and years _ This character is actually a picture of the moon, with the two horizontal lines representing the left eye and mouth of the mythical “man in the moon.” (Actually, the Japanese see a hare in the moon, but it is a little farfetched to find one in the kanji.) And one month, of course, is one cycle of the moon.
火　_ か _ ひ、び　_ fire _On reading: 火 【カ】 Tuesday, fire (second of the five elements); 火曜日 【カヨウビ】 Tuesday; 灯 【ヒ】 light, lamp, torch; 噴火 【フンカ】 eruption; Kun reading: 火 【ひ】 fire, flame, blaze; 火花 【ひばな】 spark; 飛び火 【とびひ】 leaping flames, shower of flying sparks, spreading fire, repercussions in unanticipated areas, spilling over, effects of an incident spreading to those seemingly uninvolved, impetigo contagiosa; 不知火 【しらぬい】 phosphorescent light, mysterious lights on the sea, sea fire _ Just as sitting before a fire enlivens the imagination and lets you see almost anything you want to in the µames, this kanji is so simple it lets you see almost any sort of fire you want to see. It no longer makes a good pictograph, but I invite you to take a pencil and paper and play with the form—first writing it as shown below and then adding lines here and there—to see what you can come up with. Everything from matchbooks to cigarette lighters to volcanic eruptions to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah have been found here. No doubt you, too, will find something interesting to bend your memory around these four simple strokes.
水　_ すい _ みず　_ water _On reading: 水 【スイ】 Wednesday, shaved ice (served with flavored syrup), water (fifth of the five elements); 水曜日 【スイヨウビ】 Wednesday; 香水 【コウスイ】 perfume; 淡水 【タンスイ】 fresh water (i.e. not salt water); Kun reading: 水 【みず】 water (esp. cool, fresh water, e.g. drinking water), fluid (esp. in an animal tissue), liquid, flood, floodwaters, water offered to wrestlers just prior to a bout, break granted to wrestlers engaged in a prolonged bout; 水着 【みずぎ】 bathing suit, swimsuit, swimmers; 大水 【おおみず】 flood; 雨水 【あまみず】 rain water, "rain water" solar term (approx. Feb 19) _ This character, which looks a bit like a snowµake, is actually a pictograph of water—not any particular body of water or movement of water, but simply the generic name for water. Should you have any difficulty remembering it, simply think of a walking stick being dropped vertically into the water, sending droplets out in all four directions. Then all you need to learn is how to write it in proper order.
木　_ もく _ き　_ tree _On reading: 木石 【ボクセキ】 trees and stones, unfeeling person; 木履 【ポックリ】 girl's lacquered wooden geta, wooden footwear, clogs, sabots; 大木 【タイボク】 large tree; 啄木 【タクボク】 woodpecker; 木 【モク】 Thursday, wood (first of the five elements); 木曜日 【モクヨウビ】 Thursday; 材木 【ザイモク】 lumber, timber; 樹木 【ジュモク】 trees and shrubs, arbour, arbor; Kun reading: 木 【き】 tree, shrub, bush, wood, timber; 木綿 【もめん】 cotton (material), red silk-cotton tree (Bombax ceiba); 植木 【うえき】 garden shrubs, trees, potted plant; 並木 【なみき】 roadside tree, row of trees _ Here we see a pictograph of a tree, showing the main trunk in the long vertical stroke and the boughs in the long horizontal stroke. The final two strokes sweep down in both directions to indicate the roots. Although it may look similar at first sight to the kanji for water, the order in which it is written is completely different and this affects its final appearance.
金　_ きん _ かね　_ gold; money _On reading: 金 【キン】 gold (Au), golden (color), gold (medal, cup), valuable, of highest value, gold coin, money, Friday, metal (fourth of the five elements), Jin (dynasty of China; 1115-1234 CE), gold general, testicles, karat, carat; 金曜日 【キンヨウビ】 Friday; 借金 【シャッキン】 debt, loan, liabilities; 貯金 【チョキン】 putting money aside, savings, deposit (e.g. in a bank), accumulated surplus of wins, wins in the bank; 金色 【キンイロ】 golden (colour, color); 金輪際 【コンリンザイ】 the deepest bottom of the earth, never, not ... at all, on no account, for all the world, till doomsday; 鬱金 【ウコン】 turmeric (Curcuma domestica); 葛鬱金 【クズウコン】 arrowroot (Maranta arundinacea); 漉油 【コシアブラ】 Acanthopanax sciadophylloides (species of flowering plant related to the aralias); 黄金 【オウゴン】 gold; Kun reading: 金 【かね】 money, metal; 金持ち 【かねもち】 rich person; お金 【おかね】 money; 銀 【ぎん】 silver (Ag), silver coin, money, silver medal, silver colour, silver color, silver general _ If this were not one of the most common characters you will ever have to write, I would apologize for having to give the explanation that follows. Anyway, we want to depict bars of gold bullion with an umbrella overhead to shade them from the heat (and perhaps to hide them as well). The bullion is made by melting down all the scepters of the kingdom, drop by drop, and shaping them into bars.
土　_ ど、と _ つち　_ soil _On reading: 土 【ド】 Saturday, earth (third of the five elements), Turkey; 土曜日 【ドヨウビ】 Saturday; 領土 【リョウド】 dominion, territory, possession; 国土 【コクド】 country, territory, domain, realm; 土 【ド】 Saturday, earth (third of the five elements), Turkey; 時計 【トケイ】 watch, clock, timepiece; 【コンクリート】 concrete; 率土 【ソット】 face of the earth; Kun reading: 土 【つち】 earth, soil, dirt, clay, mud, the earth (historically, esp. as opposed to the heavens), the ground, the land, low-quality torinoko-gami (containing mud), (period of) refraining from construction in the direction of the god of the earth (in On'youdou); 土埃 【つちぼこり】 dust, cloud of dust; 国土 【こくど】 country, territory, domain, realm; 粘土 【ねんど】 clay _ I don’t like it any more than you do, but this kanji is not the pictograph it is trumped up to be: a mound of soil piled on the ground. All I can recommend is that you memorize it as it is. Anyway, it will be occurring with such frequency that you have almost no chance of forgetting it, even if you try.
曜　_ よう _ _ weekday _On reading: 曜日 【ヨウビ】 day of the week; 曜霊 【ヨウレイ】 literary term for the sun; 日曜 【ニチヨウ】 Sunday; 月曜 【ゲツヨウ】 Monday _ Day ... feathers ... turkey.
上　_ じょう _ うえ、のぼ　_ up; above _On reading: 上 【ジョウ】 from the standpoint of, as a matter of (e.g. fact), in the field of, being of the type of, aboard (a ship or vehicle), on top of, on, above, first volume (e.g. book), superior quality, best, top, high class, going up, governmental, imperial, presenting, showing, ana- (medical, biol.); 上手 【ジョウズ】 skill, skillful, dexterity, flattery; 以上 【イジョウ】 not less than, ... and more, ... and upwards, beyond ... (e.g. one's means), further (e.g. nothing further to say), more than ...

But the characters do not follow that custom, so we have to choose something else, easily remembered. The primitives show a magic wand standing above a µoor—“magi-cally,” you might say. Anyway, go right on to the next frame, since the two belong together and are best remembered as a unit, just as the words above and below suggest each other.
下　_ か _ した、くだ　_ down _On reading: 下 【カ】 under (being in said condition or environment); 下位 【カイ】 low rank, subordinate, lower order (e.g. byte), low-end; 廊下 【ロウカ】 corridor, hallway, passageway; 以下 【イカ】 not exceeding, and downward, ... and below, below (e.g. standard), under (e.g. a level), the below-mentioned, the following, the rest; 下 【ゲ】 lowness (of degree, value, etc.), inferiority, second volume (of two), third volume (of three); 下宿 【ゲシュク】 boarding, lodging, boarding house; 以下 【イカ】 not exceeding, and downward, ... and below, below (e.g. standard), under (e.g. a level), the below-mentioned, the following, the rest; 上下 【ジョウゲ】 top and bottom, high and low, above and below, upper and lower ends, up and down, going up and down, rising and falling, fluctuating, going and coming back, upper and lower classes, ruler and ruled, the government and the people, first and second volumes; Kun reading: 下 【した】 below, down, under, younger (e.g. daughter), bottom, beneath, underneath, just after, right after, inferiority, one's inferior (i.e. one's junior), trade-in, preliminary, preparatory; 下着 【したぎ】 underwear; 靴下 【くつした】 socks, sock, stockings, stocking; 目下 【めした】 subordinate, subordinates, inferior, inferiors, junior; 下 【しも】 lower reaches (of a river), bottom, lower part, lower half (of the body, esp. the privates), feces (faeces), urine, menses, end, far from the imperial palace (i.e. far from Kyoto, esp. of western Japan), dirty (e.g. dirty jokes, etc.); 下手 【しもて】 lower part, foot, lower direction, left part of the stage (audience's or camera's POV), stage right (actor's POV); 川下 【かわしも】 downstream; 風下 【かざしも】 leeward, lee, downwind; 下 【もと】 under (esp. influence or guidance); 足下 【あしもと】 at one's feet, underfoot, one's step (as in "watch your step"), gait, pace, step, you, thou; 膝元 【ひざもと】 near one's knee, below one's knee, under the protection of (e.g. one's parents), under the care of, territory of a powerful person, address used after the names of one's parents, grandparents, etc. in a letter; 下げる 【さげる】 to hang, to suspend, to wear (e.g. decoration), to lower, to reduce, to bring down, to demote, to move back, to pull back, to clear (plates), to remove (food, etc. from table or altar); 下がる 【さがる】 to come down, to go down, to fall, to drop, to sink, to get lower, to hang, to dangle, to move back, to step back, to withdraw, to retire, to deteriorate, to fall off, to be downgraded, to get closer to the present day, to go south; 下る 【くだる】 to descend, to go down, to come down, to be handed down (of an order, judgment, etc.), to pass (of time), to surrender, to capitulate, (often in neg. form) to be less than, to be inferior to, to have the runs, to have diarrhea; 下り 【くだり】 down-train (going away from Tokyo), down-slope, downward going; 下り坂 【くだりざか】 descent, downhill, decline, waning; 下す 【くだす】 to make (a decision), to pass (judgement, etc.), to hand down (orders, etc.), to let go down, to lower, to do oneself, to do by oneself; 下さる 【くださる】 to give, to confer, to bestow, to kindly do for one, to oblige, to favour, to favor; 下ろす 【おろす】 to take down (e.g. flag), to launch (e.g. boat), to drop, to lower (e.g. ladder), to let (a person) off, to unload, to discharge, to drop off (a passenger from a vehicle), to let (a person) off, to withdraw money from an account, to wear (clothing) for the first time, to fillet (e.g. a fish); 降りる 【おりる】 to descend (e.g. a mountain), to go down, to come down, to alight (e.g. from bus), to get off, to disembark, to dismount, to step down, to retire, to give up, to quit, to be granted, to be issued, to be given, to form (of frost, dew, mist, etc.), to be passed (from the body; e.g. of a roundworm) _ Here we see our famous miraculous magic wand hanging, all on its own, below the ceiling, as you probably already guessed would happen. In addition to giving us two new kanji, the two shapes given in this and the preceding frame also serve to fix the use of the primitives for ceiling and µoor, by drawing our attention successively to the line standing above and below the primitive element to which it is related.
中　_ ちゅう、じゅう _ なか　_ in, inside, middle _On reading: 中 【チュウ】 medium, average, middle, moderation, middle school, China, in, out of (e.g. three out of ten people), during (a certain time when one did or is doing something), under (construction, etc.), while; 中学校 【チュウガッコウ】 junior high school, middle school, lower secondary school; 途中 【トチュウ】 on the way, en route, in the middle of, midway; 集中 【シュウチュウ】 concentration, convergence, centralization, integration, gathering together; Kun reading: 中 【なか】 inside, in, among, within, center (centre), middle, during, while; 中中 【なかなか】 very, considerably, easily, readily, fairly, quite, highly, rather, by no means (with negative verb), not readily, middle, half-way point, excellent, wonderful, very good; お腹 【おなか】 stomach; 背中 【せなか】 back (of body); 内 【うち】 inside, within, while, among, amongst, between, we (referring to one's in-group, i.e. company, etc.), our, my spouse, imperial palace grounds, emperor, I (primarily used by women and children), me; この内 【このうち】 among these, between these, of these, in here, in this; 此の内 【このうち】 meanwhile, the other day, recently; 当たる 【あたる】 to be hit, to strike, to touch, to be in contact, to be affixed, to be equivalent to, to be applicable, to apply to, to be right on the money (of a prediction, criticism, etc.), to be selected (in a lottery, etc.), to win, to be successful, to go well, to be a hit, to face, to confront, to lie (in the direction of), to undertake, to be assigned, to be stricken (by food poisoning, heat, etc.), to be afflicted, to be called upon (by the teacher), to treat (esp. harshly), to lash out at, to be unnecessary, to be hitting well, to be on a hitting streak, (in fishing) to feel a bite, (of fruit, etc.) to be bruised, to spoil, to feel (something) out, to probe into, to check (i.e. by comparison), to shave, to be a relative of a person, to stand in a relationship _ The elements here are a walking stick and a mouth. Remember the trouble your mother had getting medicine in your mouth? Chances are it crossed her mind more than once to grab something handy, like your grandfather’s walking stick, to pry open your jaws while she performed her duty. Keep the image of getting something in from the outside, and the otherwise abstract sense of this key word should be a lot easier than trying to spoon castor oil into a baby’s mouth.
半　_ はん _ _ half _On reading: 半 【ハン】 half, semi-, half-past, odd number, unit of land area (595.8 m^2); 半分 【ハンブン】 half; 大半 【タイハン】 majority, mostly, generally; 時半 【ジハン】 about an hour, short time, half past (the hour) _ Although the writing order is different, one can remember the appearance of this character by seeing it as a little needle—the kind used for splitting hairs in half. (Again, according to rule, little takes a stroke beneath it in order to be placed over an element that has no horizontal line at the top.) Character refers to the changeable moods and airs of one’s personality as well as to the more essential combination of vital forces that distinguish things and individuals one from the other. Its elements are: reclining ... floor ... fishhook ... sheaf.
天　_ てん _　_ heaven _On reading: 天 【テン】 sky, heaven, svarga (heaven-like realm visited as a stage of death and rebirth), deva (divine being of Buddhism); 天気 【テンキ】 weather, the elements, fair weather, fine weather; 晴天 【セイテン】 fine weather (i.e. little or no clouds), fair weather, clear weather, clear sky, fair skies; 雨天 【ウテン】 rainy weather; Kun reading: 天津 【あまつ】 heavenly, imperial; 天津乙女 【あまつおとめ】 celestial maiden; 天 【てん】 sky, heaven, svarga (heaven-like realm visited as a stage of death and rebirth), deva (divine being of Buddhism); 天地 【てんち】 heaven and earth, the universe, nature, top and bottom, realm, sphere, world, top and bottom, gods of heaven and earth _ This character is meant to be a pictograph of a great man, said to represent the Lord of the Heavens.

We are more accustomed to seeing it straightened out as part of other shapes—for instance, as the second stroke of mouth. If you need any help at all with this character, you may picture it as two hands of a clock pointing to what time it is now. The element above it, meeting, should easily relate to that image.

Be careful when writing this character to get the order of the strokes correct.

A little farfetched, until you draw the character and feel the grace and row of the three simple strokes. Remembering the kanji is easy; learning to write it beautifully is another thing.

Surely, somewhere in your experience, there is a vivid image just waiting to be dragged up to help you remember this character.
行　_ こう、ぎょう _ い　_ to go _On reading: 行 【コウ】 going, travelling (traveling), type of classical Chinese verse (usu. an epic), district (of similar merchants), guild, bank; 行動 【コウドウ】 action, conduct, behaviour, behavior, mobilization, mobilisation; 旅行 【リョコウ】 travel, trip; 銀行 【ギンコウ】 bank; 行 【ギョウ】 line (i.e. of text), row, verse, carya (austerities), samskara (formations), running script (a semi-cursive style of kanji); 行儀 【ギョウギ】 manners, behavior, behaviour; 施行 【シコウ】 execution, enforcing, carrying out, giving alms, giving food to the poor or monks; 一行 【イチギョウ】 line, row, troupe, party; 行脚 【アンギャ】 pilgrimage, traveling on foot; 行火 【アンカ】 bed warmer, foot warmer; Kun reading: 行く 【いく】 to go, to move (in a direction or towards a specific location), to head (towards), to be transported (towards), to reach, to proceed, to take place, to pass through, to come and go, to walk, to die, to pass away, to do (in a specific way), to stream, to flow, to continue, to have an orgasm, to come, to cum, to trip, to get high, to have a drug-induced hallucination; 行く先先 【ゆくさきざき】 everywhere, everywhere one goes, wherever one goes; 行く 【いく】 to go, to move (in a direction or towards a specific location), to head (towards), to be transported (towards), to reach, to proceed, to take place, to pass through, to come and go, to walk, to die, to pass away, to do (in a specific way), to stream, to flow, to continue, to have an orgasm, to come, to cum, to trip, to get high, to have a drug-induced hallucination; 行方 【ゆくえ】 (one's) whereabouts, outcome; 行う 【おこなう】 to perform, to do, to conduct oneself, to carry out _ By joining the top four strokes, you should get a picture of the front current of a river, the stream trailing behind. Hence the character for going.

But you might also try breaking the halo down into drop and silver, which would give you “silverware,” an additional primitive meaning that could come in useful later on.
